# Name of the project &middot; [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/npm/npm/latest.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/npm/npm) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm)

A brief description of your project, what problem does it solve. Limit this to around three lines. 

## Installing / Getting started

Step by step instructions (with commands) for getting the project running locally.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

How to contribute to the codebase:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

explain what happens after the above steps

### Deploying / Publishing
Give any details pertaining to deploying or publishing

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

Use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

## Tests

Give an overview of the tesitng strategy used and what should be maintained going forward.

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

```shell
